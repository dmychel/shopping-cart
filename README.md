# Serena Shopping

Welcome to Serena Shopping! This is a a simple page to mock the checkout process of an ecommerce website. This project is not meant to be very complex nor be very UI impressive. The goal of this project is to demonstrate the use of React Router Dom and my ability to build an app that is more applicable to something I'd be working on as a professional in the field.

# VERSION 1.0

Version 1.0 includes the ability to add and remove items from your cart. The header will display the amount of items in your cart. When you navigate to the Cart page the subtotal, taxes, grand total, and cart items are displayed. You can remove individual cart items from this page and the totals will be updated accordingly.
